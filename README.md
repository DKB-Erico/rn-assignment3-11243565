# Description
This is a React Native project which was made to recreate and style the project to closely match a given UI, make use of various components, include categories and a list.

# Project Components Overview

## App Component

The `App` component serves as the main entry point of the application. It includes a greeting and a task count, along with a profile image. The component uses `View` for layout and `ScrollView` for scrolling to view hidden parts of a page.

## SearchBar Component

The `SearchBar` component provides a user interface for inputting search queries. It consists of a text input field and a button to initiate the search or open filters. The component utilizes `TextInput` for the input field, `Image` for icons, and `TouchableOpacity` for the clickable button.

## CategorySection Component

The `CategorySection` component displays a horizontal list of categories, each with an associated image and title. It uses `FlatList` for efficient rendering of the list, `Image` for displaying category images, and `Text` for category titles.

## CategoryList Component

The `CategoryList` component renders a list of ongoing tasks. It uses `View` to create containers for each task and `Text` to display the task names. The component is designed to display tasks in a clean and organized manner.

## Frame Component

The `Frame` component likely acts as a header or banner, displaying a welcome message and the number of tasks for the day. It uses `View` for layout, `Text` for messages, and `Image` for a decorative or personal touch.

Each component is styled using `StyleSheet` to ensure a consistent and responsive design across different devices. The components are modular, making them reusable and easy to maintain.
